### What problem will you face without this guide?

**Losing an estimated 200 hours** figuring out how to do everything by your own. I know this because that's how much I had to spend myself.

In Finland, there are many extensive guides by authorities which have precise information about everything you need to know.
The problem is, however, that the **target audience of those guides are the general population** and out of every 100 pages, maybe 10 pages are relevant to your situation.

For myself, I had questions like:

* How to get freelance projects without any network of my own?
* What you need to do _before_ you establish your company to be eligible for government grants?
* When you setup your company, what are your recurring _obligations_?

Figuring those questions out was tiring and very time consuming.
