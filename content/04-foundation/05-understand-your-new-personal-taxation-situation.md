### Understand your new personal taxation situation

**What is it?** As a `self-employed` person, your payslip is going to be different than what you used to have as
an `employee` and practically speaking, you only pay `income tax` and nothing else.

**How is the payslip for an `employee`?** Imagine a basic example, in which an `employee` receives 1,000€ salary, and her/his tax card says their tax is 20%.

From the `employee`'s perspective:

1. The employer withholds 20% of 1,000€ as `income tax` => 200€
2. The employer withholds 7.15% of 1,000€ as `TyEL pension insurance contribution` => 71,5€
3. The employer withholds 1.25% of 1,000€ as `unemployment insurance contribution` => 12,5€
4. The employer pays withheld amount of 284€ to Tax Administration and other insurance providers.
5. The *employee* receives the rest which is 716€.

From the `employer`'s perspective:

1. The employer has to pay 18.15% of 1,000€ as `Employee's pension insurance contribution` => 181,5€
2. The employer has to pay 0.45% of 1,000€ as `Employer’s unemployment insurance contribution` => 4,5€
3. The employer has to pay 0.70% of 1,000€ as `Occupational accident and disease insurance contribution` => 7€
4. The employer has to pay 0.07% of 1,000€ as `Group life insurance contribution` => 0,7€
5. The employer has to pay 1.34% of 1,000€ as `Employers’ health insurance contribution` => 13,4€
6. The employer pays ~207€ to Tax Administration and other insurance providers.

**How is the payslip for a `self-employed`?** Imagine a basic example, in which a `self-employed` person receives 1,000€ salary from their own company, and her/his tax card says their tax is 20%.

From the `self-employed`'s perspective:

1. Their company withholds 20% of 1,000€ as `income tax` => 200€
2. Their company pays withheld amount of 200€ to Tax Administration.
3. The *self-employed* receives the rest which is 800€.

From the company's perspective:

1. The company has to pay 1.34% of 1,000€ as `Employers’ health insurance contribution` => 13,4€
2. The company pays 13,4€ to Tax Administration.

**What's the practical conclusion?** Because `Employers’ health insurance contribution` is such a small percentage, in the rest of this guide, I will intentionally assume
that the `self-employed` people only pay `income tax` and nothing else.
