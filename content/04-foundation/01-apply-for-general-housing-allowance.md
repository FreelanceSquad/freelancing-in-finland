> As an entrepreneur, you are entitled to the general housing allowance under the same conditions as anyone else.

**How much?** Based on the simplified assumption that your only source of **personal** income is startup grant and you don't live with another person in the same household,
general housing allowance is ~410€ per month, tax free, for a studio in Helsinki. You can use **source of truth** calculator for exact figures.

**What counts as a `self-employed` person's income from Kela's perspective**?

* Your company:
  * is a `legal entity` with a business ID (Y-tunnus)
  * can **act** like a natural person from the perspective of law
  * pays taxes on its **profits** in the form of _corporate taxation_, 20%, once a year
* You:
  * are a `natural person` with a personal ID (Henkilötunnus)
  * are a natural person from the perspective of law
  * pay taxes on your **income** in the form of _personal taxation_, at progressive rates, whenever you receive income
* For the purpose of answering _what counts as a `self-employed` person's income from Kela's perspective_, your company's income is irrelevant.
* Your income is relevant. If you have [YEL](#buy-social-security-insurance-yel):
  * Your `YEL income` is counted as your income, nothing else.
  * You do not need to apply for general housing allowance review unless you change your `YEL income`.
* If you don't have YEL:
  * All your income (salary, benefits, dividends, etc) counts as your income.
  * You need to apply for general housing allowance review if your income increases by 400€ per month.

**Steps**:

* Apply for general housing allowance [electronically](https://asiointi.kela.fi/go_app) (only available in Finnish).
* Mention in application that you have received a positive decision to your startup grant application and you have quit your job.
* Attach your startup grant official decision letter which has come via post to the application.
* Attach your employment certificate which mentions the final date of your employment to the application.
* If you don't have the attachments ready, you can still attach them to the application for ~10 days after sending the application.
* You will receive a decision in ~3 weeks (official estimation).
