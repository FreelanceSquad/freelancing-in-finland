### Buy social security insurance YEL

**What is it?** YEL is a mandatory social security insurance for `self-employed` persons.
**YEL official name is very misleading** (*Self-Employed Personâ€™s Pensions Act*), because **YEL determines your entire social security benefits**, <ins>not</ins> just your pension.

For example, if you get sick, your *daily sickness allowance* is calculated based on your YEL. The more you pay for YEL, the more *daily sickness allowance* you get.

Similarly, when you want to [buy a health insurance](https://github.com/sam-hosseini/freelancing-in-finland#consider-buying-health-insurance), no insurance company
will sell you one without YEL. Because *YEL is the foundation* and a private health insurance <ins>builds on top</ins> of YEL.

**What is `YEL income` and `YEL contribution`?**

* `YEL income`:
  * Has absolutely nothing to do with your real world income (salary, benefits, dividends, etc).
  * Is how much ***coverage*** in social security you would like to have.
  * You have the freedom to choose between ~8000â‚¬ up to ~180,000â‚¬ per year.
* `YEL contribution`:
  * Is how much you **pay** for your ***coverage***.
  * Is ~19% of your `YEL income`, which means you pay ~125â‚¬ up to ~2820â‚¬ per month as a business cost.

**Steps**:

* You have 6 months from starting self-employment to buy YEL.
    * If, however, your company has not had income equal to minimum `YEL income`, i.e. ~8000â‚¬, you do not need to buy YEL yet.
    * When your company gets income above the level of minimum `YEL income`, you'll have to buy YEL within the 6 months mentioned above.
    * Even though you have 6 months to buy YEL, if e.g. you had to buy YEL from the 3rd month because that's when your company had more than ~8000â‚¬ of income,
      even if you buy YEL at the 5th month, you'll have to select the starting date of YEL to be from the 3rd month as that's the date when you were obligated to buy YEL anyway.

* Buy YEL from an YEL insurance provider:
  * [elo](https://www.elo.fi/?sc_lang=en)
  * [varma](https://www.varma.fi/en/)
  * [ilmarinen](https://www.ilmarinen.fi/en/)
  * [veritas](https://www.veritas.fi/en/)
* I don't know if any provider is better than the other. Do you know which one is the best? Please send a pull request ðŸ’¯
