### Consider joining a union

**What is it?** A union is an organization which can offer its members certain services at a much lower price and lobby the interests of its members with relevant authorities.

**How much?** ~165‚Ç¨ per year.

**When is it necessary?** Given the union membership fee, and the 200‚Ç¨ average hourly rate of lawyers in Finland,
if you have 2-4 questions about running your business per year, the membership fee will pay itself back.

For example, I had a question about corporate law, and wanted to know what happens if my Deputy Member of the Board of Directors leaves
the company. I called the union and within 5 minutes, I was talking with a lawyer who knew about corporate law and got my answer.

In addition to that, unions negotiate the `self-employed` interests. For example, from July 2019, you no longer have to put 2500‚Ç¨ initial
capital into the company when establishing a limited liability company. This has been one of the points from
[Business Legislation agenda of Suomen Yritt√§j√§t union](https://www.yrittajat.fi/en/about-federation-finnish-enterprises/fields-influence/business-legislation-598844),
among other points.

**Unions**:

* [Kauppakamari - Finland chamber of commerce](https://kauppakamari.fi/en/)
  * [Helsinki chamber of commerce](https://helsinki.chamber.fi/en/)

I don't know if there are other unions or which one is better than the other. Do you know which one is the best? Please send a pull request üíØ
