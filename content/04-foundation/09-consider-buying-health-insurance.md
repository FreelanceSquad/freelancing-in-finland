### Consider buying health insurance

**Source of truth**: [Ministry of Social Affairs and Health](https://stm.fi/en/frontpage)

**What is it?** As a `self-employed` person, you are not legally obligated to buy `occupational healthcare` for yourself.
Therefore, when you fall ill and the issue is not urgent, you can go to public health stations or private.
To partially or fully cover the medical costs, you may want to buy an appropriate health insurance.

**How do public and private compare?**

* In **public**:
    * You cannot go to any public health station, you should go to the health station assigned to you.
    * You cannot book a doctor's appointment online.
    * You cannot jump the [Nurse -> Doctor -> Specialist] rule.
    * You will not pay more than ~700‚Ç¨ per year for medical costs or ~600‚Ç¨ per year for medicine [as there are laws protecting you from that](https://stm.fi/terveydenhuollon-maksukatto).
* In **private**:
    * You can go to any private health station you wish.
    * You can book your appointments online and usually get a doctor's appointment either the same day or day-after.
    * There's no rule preventing you from seeing an specialist straight away.
    * It's expensive.

**When is it necessary?** If you wish to go to private for non-urgent issues and you'd like the health insurance to cover it.
