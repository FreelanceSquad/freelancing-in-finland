### Find an accountant

**What is it?** Having an accountant is <ins>not mandatory by law</ins>. However, as the CEO of your company, the ultimate and final responsibility for correctness of your books
and all your company's tax obligations is on **you**, and <ins>when the law comes to you</ins> in the form of random tax inspections carried out by Tax Administration, having had a
good accountant who have corrected your mistakes and fulfilled your company's tax obligations on time, every month, could prevent potential complications with Tax Administration.

**How much?** Varies. Accountants will either charge you hourly or a fixed price, which is based on their estimation of how much time they'll spend per month on your business.
A freelancing company for the target audience of this guide with no other activities will take at least an hour or two of their time,
and if we take a 75â‚¬/hour rate, you should expect to pay at least 75-150â‚¬ per month.
