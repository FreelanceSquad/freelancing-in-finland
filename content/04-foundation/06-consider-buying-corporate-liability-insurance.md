### Consider buying corporate liability insurance

**What is it?** An insurance to cover the potential damages you may cause to your client while freelancing.
For example, if you drop the production database and it would take 5 hours to recover from that mistake, and
your client claims 100,000â‚¬ in damages for those 5 hours, corporate liability insurance may cover it.

**When is it necessary?** Even though it's not mandatory by law, it may be mandatory by the contract you'll sign with freelance brokers or the client itself.

Some components of a corporate liability insurance, like *legal expenses insurance*, require you to have signed the corporate liability insurance **before** signing your project contract
in order for the insurance cover to be valid. If that is the case and you have already signed the project contract, discuss with the insurance agent to find a solution to the problem.

**How much?** Insurance companies decide the price based on a number of factors including but not limited to your main line of business and your estimated annual revenue.
I have received offers from ~200â‚¬ up to ~500â‚¬ per year from different insurance providers.
