### How can this guide solve the problem?

By **narrowing down the target audience** to the person reading this guide on Github, you wouldn't lose the time I lost.

You are the target audience of this guide if:

* You are already living in Finland for more than 3 months
* You are already working as a software developer
* You want to work as an independent freelance software developer
* You want to establish a limited liability company to offer your freelance services through it

This guide is under [MIT license](https://github.com/sam-hosseini/freelancing-in-finland/blob/master/LICENSE) which means **use it at your own risk**,
I'm not a lawyer and no statement here should be thought of as legal advice.
