### Open a business bank account

**What is it?** A business account for your company's business activities.

**How much?** ~40€ per month. Base prices might start from ~10€ but in *business* accounts, unlike *personal* accounts,
almost anything that happens in the eco-system of your business will cost you something and will drive the total cost to around ~40€.
Revolut for Business and some other foreign fintech companies also provide free alternatives, which may be suitable if you only have
a few transactions a month.
