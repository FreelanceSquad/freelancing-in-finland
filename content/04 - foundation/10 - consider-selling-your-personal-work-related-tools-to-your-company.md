### Consider selling your personal work-related tools to your company

**Source of truth**: [Tax Administration](https://www.vero.fi/en/)

**What is it?** When you were an `employee`, your employer gave you work-related tools like laptop, phone, desk and a chair to do your work.
Now, your company (`legal entity`) can buy from you (`natural person`) work-related tools in a similar fashion.


**When is it useful?** If you didn't have work-related tools when you started your company, you would have bought them from company's money as *business costs*.
Now, by selling what you already have to the company, it's as if you're retroactively turning what used to be a personal cost into a *business cost*.

**How much?** Their current *fair market value*. If you bought an iPhone for 1000€ two years ago, and you sell it to your company for 500€ because in most 2nd hand stores
you see that the market price is ~500€ nowadays, that's a *fair market value*. If you sell it for 950€, tax administration might consider that a *disguised dividend* to the owner.

**Steps**:

* List all *work-related* items you'd like to sell to your company. Here are some items you might have had before you started your company:
    * Laptop
    * Phone
    * Desk
    * Chair
    * Printer
    * Offline storage devices
* Take a picture of the item and its receipt if you still have it to prove the item actually exists as an attachment to the invoice you'll be sending to your company.
* Take a picture of a 2nd hand store advertisement for an item similar to yours to prove that you were in the ballpark of their *fair market value* as an attachment to the invoice you'll be sending to your company.
* Create a contract which includes the followings as an attachment to the invoice you'll be sending to your company:
    * Who is buying
    * Who is selling
    * What is being sold and their *fair market value* price
    * Signature, place, and date
* Send an invoice to your company with all attachments above.
* Your company won't get any VAT refunds from the items it buys from you. This is because you, as the *natural person*, are not registered in VAT-register. It doesn't matter if you mention the price of the laptop for example includes 24% VAT; in your company's accounting, it'll be VAT 0% anyway.
