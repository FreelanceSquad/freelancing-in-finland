### Consider joining an unemployment fund

**Source of truth**: [Kela unemployment page](https://www.kela.fi/web/en/unemployment)
and [Unemployment Fund for the self-employed](https://syt.fi/)

**What is it?** There are two types of unemployment benefits:

1. **Basic** unemployment allowance, which is paid by Kela and the amount is the same for everyone, ~700€ per month.
2. **Earnings-related** unemployment allowance, which is paid by *unemployment funds* and the amount for the `self-employed` people depends on their `YEL income`.

You can only apply for earnings-related unemployment allowance if you're part of an unemployment fund.



**How much?** Depends on your `YEL income`. Unemployment law enforces a higher minimum `YEL income` if you wish to be part of an unemployment fund.
The minimum is ~13,000€ `YEL income`, and with that, membership fee is ~155€ per year.

**When is it necessary?** If you wish to get earnings-related unemployment allowance in case of unemployment.

Note that **receiving any kind of unemployment allowance requires permanent closure of your company** and registering as
a job-seeker to be a full-time `employee` again, among other things.
