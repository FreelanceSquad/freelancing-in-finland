I can tell you that I wrote this guide **with both selfish and selfless reasons**.

* Selfish reasons:
  * **I wanted to make money**. I didn't know how exactly to monetize this guide or other things that could come out of it 😄, and there were multiple suggestions by friends and colleagues
but in the end [it didn't receive widespread attention](https://github.com/sam-hosseini/freelancing-in-finland/issues/26) and that's ok, live and learn 📚
  * I wanted to increase my visibility in the freelancing network as a Python developer 🐍 and with that, I would have the leverage to charge higher hourly rates 💶 =>

  * Later in my life, I want to launch my own products but because I'm an underdog on Twitter 😁,
  I was hoping to get more Twitter followers so that my best friends wouldn't be the only ones liking my later-in-life Producthunt launch posts 😅 =>

* Selfless reasons:
  * Software developers and the community are extremely generous and having been mostly *taking*, I wanted to give back as well.
  * From the bottom of my heart, I wanted to help you start your freelance journey and that this guide would save you the headache of
  having to read so many pages of different guides to do things correctly and in the right order.
  * I like it that when you have your own company, the profits generated get distributed more proportionally to those involved compared to being an employee,
  and so I was hoping by providing some exact figures on revenues and costs, I'd inspire you to take a bigger risk and be proportionally compensated for it.
