### Network with freelance brokers and organizations

**What is it?** To find a project that you like, there are companies that can help you with that.
Most require a meeting before they let you in their network. It's always a relaxed meeting, though, as you will be _partners_ who will help each other.

**How does it work?** They find you a project. They add around 5-20% to your hourly rate. You invoice them. They invoice the end client.

**What happens in the meeting?**

* They ask if you know their company and depending on that, they introduce you accordingly.
* They ask about your story.
* They ask if there's an industry that you particularly like/dislike to work in.
* They ask about your hourly rate.
* You can ask about their principles and priorities for the possible partnership with you.
* You can ask if they offer any other services than finding a project.
* You can ask about their *terms of payment*, i.e. how many days until they pay your sales invoice.
* You can ask if there are any restrictions in place if you take a project from them in the form of NDAs or non-competition.

**What about hourly rate?** In Helsinki, if we put aside particular situations in which the client has become dependent on a single point of failure developer,
or other extraordinary situations, in an average project with an average client with an average developer, I've heard companies charging their clients between
90-130€ per hour depending on the strength of their brand, the experience of the developers in the team, and the particular relationship with that client.
In extraordinary situations, I've heard of 150-200€ per hour.

However, the ranges above are for direct company-to-client sales. If you get connected to a client using an intermediary broker company, the ranges will be cut
by 5-20%, which would be their cut of the hourly rate. This means that, with one intermediary company, you're looking at 65-105€ per hour in non-extraordinary situations.
