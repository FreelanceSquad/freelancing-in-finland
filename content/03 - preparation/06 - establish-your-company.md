### Establish your company

**Source of truth**: [Business Information System](https://www.ytj.fi/en/index.html)

**What is it?** You need to establish a *limited liability company* (Oy) to be able to offer your freelance services and **protect your personal assets** from a legal perspective.

This *limited liability* is such an extremely important concept that I encourage you to watch
[Khan Academy video on corporations and limited liability](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/corporate-taxation/v/corporations-and-limited-liability)
to become fully aware of its implications.


**TL;DR of video**: Working under your own name as a private trader (toiminimi) gives you **unlimited** liability and all your personal assets like your home, car, and
personal savings are up for grabs if worst happens.
In case of a limited liability company, the liability is *limited* and the company can declare bankruptcy if worst
happens, and your personal assets are immune from the liability of the company.


**How much?** ~275€ for online registration. It's a business cost. Later,
when your company is registered and accounting and bank account are setup,
you can claim this ~275€ back from the company as you paid this money from your *personal* bank account even though it was a *business* cost.

**What is the role of Business Information System?**

* What Finnish Digital Agency (Digi- ja väestötietovirasto) is to you, Business Information System (ytj) is to your company.
* This means that in the same manner that you came to life, in the eye of Finnish authorities, by getting a personal ID (henkilötunnus) from Finnish Digital Agency,
your company will come to life by getting a company ID (Y-tunnus) from Business Information System.
* Similarly, in the same way that you update your personal information like your address after you move apartments in Finnish Digital Agency,
you'll update your company's information in Business Information System if there are changes.
* Business Information System is also the **single place** in which you can communicate with and join/exit various registries by Tax Administration (Vero) and Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH).
  * Tax Administration maintains:
    * Prepayment register (Ennakkoperintärekisteri), which allows your company to take care of its own taxes.
    * VAT register (Arvonlisäverovelvollisuus), which allows your company to report VAT related matters.
    * Employer register (Työnantajarekisteri), which allows your company to report `employee`-related matters.
  * Finnish Patent and Registration Office maintains:
    * Trade register (Kaupparekisteri), which stores your company's information.

**Steps**:

* If you're still on your notice period from the time [you quit your job](#quit-your-job):
    * Get a written permission from your `employer` that it's OK for you to establish your company.
    * This is because starting a company in the same line of business as your `employer` [might be in violation of your non-competition agreement](https://www.tek.fi/en/services/legal-consulting/legal-data-bank/competing-activities-and-non-competition-agreements).

* Choose a company name.
  * Search for your chosen name in [Name Checking Service for Companies](https://nimipalvelu.prh.fi/nipa/en)
  * If no exact match or very-similar names were found for your chosen name, then probably it will be accepted in the application process.
  * You will be given 3 fields for company name, so prepare 2 backup names as well in case your primary name cannot be registered.

* Choose your main line of business.
  * Source of truth: [Statistics Finland](https://stat.fi/en/luokitukset/toimiala/toimiala_1_20080101/)
  * Required by Tax Administration.
  * For freelancing, you can choose any from [\[Information and communication > Computer programming, consultancy and related activities\]](https://stat.fi/en/luokitukset/toimiala/toimiala_1_20080101/?code=62&name=Computer%20programming,%20consultancy%20and%20related%20activities)
that you feel is most relevant.
  * `62010 Computer programming activities` is common as several freelancing agencies like Futurice and Reaktor have chosen that, so you can go with that as well.

* Choose your company's fiscal year ending.
  * Fiscal year is the 12-month period in which your company operates.
  * *First* fiscal year is always an exception and it can be less than 12 months or up to a maximum of 18 months.
  * Fiscal year can be the same as `calendar` year and finish at the end of December.
  * Fiscal year can also end at other times, like end of September, March, etc.
  * A lot of companies have their fiscal year the same as `calendar` year and this makes accounting offices really busy during the turn of the year.
To avoid this busy season, you can choose a fiscal year that ends well before (September) or after (April) the turn of the year.

* Get another person's consent to be your *Deputy Member of the Board of Directors*.
  * According to [Limited Liability Companies Act](https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2006/en20060624.pdf) in Chapter 6, Section 8.1:
    > There  shall  be  between  one  and  five  regular  Members  of  the  Board  of Directors, unless it is otherwise provided in the Articles of Association. If there are  fewer  than  three  Members,  there  shall be  at  least one  Deputy  Member of the Board of Directors.

  * This means that, for your company to be legally compliant, it must have a *Deputy Member of the Board of Directors* when you are going to be the *only* regular member of Board of Directors as the CEO.
  * *Deputy Member of the Board of Directors* would be held liable only [for decisions they make in board meetings](https://www.yrittajat.fi/uutiset/610877-saitko-kutsun-osakeyhtion-hallituksen-varajaseneksi-sinullakin-saattaa-olla#528cbe2f). In practice, unless you die or you are permanently unable to act as the CEO, *Deputy Member of the Board of Directors* won't have to make any decision so you can communicate this fact to them to help them with their decision making.
  * Once you get the person's consent, get his/her personal ID (henkilötunnus) as you'll need it for establishing the company.

* Decide the registries you'd like your company to be part of:
  * Trade register ✅, as the company cannot come into life without it.
  * Prepayment register ✅, as without it, other companies have to withhold taxes on the amounts they pay you.
  * VAT register ✅, as you can start deducting VAT from things or services you  purchase for your *main line of business*. For example, if you buy a laptop for 2,000€, you'll get ~500€ back (VAT 24%).
  * Employer register ❌, because you don't need it if you're not employing anyone else. The fact that you're employing yourself is irrelevant as you're considered `self-employed`, not an `employee`.
You can join later, once and if you start employing others.

* Establish your company online by filing a *startup notification* at [Business Information System](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) (only available in Finnish)
  * Do not add your email, phone number, or any other information in the public information section of the *startup notification* application.
This would prevent scammers calling you and selling you a "service", in which you might say "Ok, yes, that's fine" to get rid of them, and they'd start sending you invoices which you have to jump over dozens of
obstacles to remove yourself from the so called "service" they offered you. They can do that because in Finland, verbal agreement is as binding as writing, which the scammers take advantage of inappropriately.
  * You can also give power of attorney in Business Information System to an accountant so that they can establish the company on your behalf.

* Once your company is established, you must file a *notification* of beneficial owners in [Business Information System](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap)
    * The only [*beneficial owner*](https://www.prh.fi/en/kaupparekisteri/beneficial_owner_details.html) will be you (natural person) since you're the only owner of the company.
    * You can do this by clicking on "Tosiasialliset edunsaajat (omistajat)" in Business Information System once you login and following the instructions.

* Remember that the *legal purpose* of your company is to generate profits.
  * This is based on [Limited Liability Companies Act](https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2006/en20060624.pdf):
    > Section 5 - Purpose

    > **The purpose of a company is to generate profits for the shareholders**, unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Association.
  * That is why, for example, you cannot give a loan with 0% interest from your company to other `natural persons` or `legal entities`, as that wouldn't generate profits for your company.
