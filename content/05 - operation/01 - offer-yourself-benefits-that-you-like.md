### Offer yourself benefits that you like

**Source of truth**: [Tax Administration](https://www.vero.fi/en/detailed-guidance/decisions/47380/in-kind-benefits-fringe-benefits-2020/)

**What is it?** You can offer yourself all the benefits `employees` have access to as a `self-employed` person. Up to the tax-free limits, it'll be only a business cost.

* Phone benefit: you can pay your phone bill from company if you offer it as a 20â‚¬-phone-benefit every month to yourself.
Phone bills are business cost when you only and only use it for business and not in your personal life. If you'd like to use a single subscription for both personal and business,
you must offer it as a 20â‚¬-phone-benefit.
* Internet subscription: your company can provide you an internet subscription for your home office. The subscription is not taxed if it is for work use. You can use it for personal use as well,
but entertainment services should not be attached to the subscription, or the benefit will be taxable.
* Vehicles: your company can own a car, bikes, etc. that you can use for commuting to your client office and work-related trips. Naturally, as your company owns these vehicles, all their repairs and maintenance are *business costs* which you can pay from your company and like every other *business cost*, get a refund for its VAT later.
If you need to use these vehicles for non-work-related trips, ask your accountant whether it's a taxable benefit for you and act accordingly.
* Massage benefit: if you offer yourself a *reasonable* amount of massage benefit (~50â‚¬/month for example) and that reasonable amount is *proportionate* to the amount of salary your pay yourself, you should be able to offer yourself massage benefit without a problem. However, just like all-things-tax-related, it's the Tax Administration officer who decides what's *reasonable* and what's *proportionate*.
Therefore, practice caution with this particular benefit.

**Can you offer yourself only benefits?** Yes you can, but you must take a big enough salary to cover the `income tax` of the benefits you're offering yourself.

For example, let's say in March, you paid your phone bill from company and therefore you must offer yourself a 20â‚¬-phone-benefit. You want no additional salary and your tax rate is 10%.

10% of 20â‚¬-phone-benefit is 2â‚¬. This means that you must take a big enough salary in March to cover this 2â‚¬ tax that you have to pay.
Therefore, in March, your salary must be 2.22â‚¬. When you deduct your 10% tax from 2.22â‚¬ salary, 2â‚¬ is left, which will cover the 2â‚¬ tax that you have to pay for 20â‚¬-phone-benefit.

**Should you offer yourself benefits above the tax-free limit?** You can but it will be similar to taking salary in case of a `self-employed` person.

As seen in [understanding your new personal taxation situation](#understand-your-new-personal-taxation-situation), the `self-employed` only pay `income tax` on their income and nothing else.
So if you offer yourself 1000â‚¬ salary and your tax rate is 20%, you get 800â‚¬. If you offer yourself 1000â‚¬ as benefit, you will also get 800â‚¬.

**Who ensures that you do not go above the tax-free limit?** Your company, the `legal entity`, must ensure that its owner, you as the `natural person`, is not offered benefits above the tax-free
limits, because if you are offered, it must be reported and taxed. This is important, because you as the representative of the company can order even 10,000â‚¬ of Sport and cultural benefit, but
if you go ahead and use it all within that calendar year, you must report it and pay tax on the 9600â‚¬ part.
