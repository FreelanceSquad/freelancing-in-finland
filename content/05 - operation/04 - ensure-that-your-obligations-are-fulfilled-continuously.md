### Ensure that your obligations are fulfilled continuously

Tax administration office (Vero):

* **Pay your corporate income tax on time** using prepayment register, *non-recurring* obligation: if your company fiscal year ends and
you have paid no corporate income tax during the fiscal year, and it turns out you must pay thousands of euros of corporate income tax,
then the Tax Administration will add interest on this coporate tax you owe them. To avoid paying interest, pay your corporate income tax *before* the company fiscal year ends,
or *within 1 month* after it.

* **Send VAT reports**, *recurring* obligation: strictly speaking, as the owner of the company, you are responsible to ensure that VAT reports are done every month, not your accountant.
Practically, your accountant assumes responsibility for it and will do it herself/himself, but remember that if your accountant fails to do so, you yourself are responsible.
Therefore, check before the deadlines if the VAT reports have been done.

* **Send EU VAT Recapitulative Statement reports**, *recurring* obligation: if you're invoicing a EU company, you need to [report its details](https://www.vero.fi/en/businesses-and-corporations/about-corporate-taxes/vat/international-commerce/intra-community-trade/eu-vat-recapitulative-statement/).
This obligation is similar to *VAT reports* in the sense that it's fully your responsibility that this report is done correctly and on time, even though your accountant will do this for you.

* **Send payroll reports**, *recurring* obligation: if you're taking out salary, *Employer Contribution report* and *Income Register report* must be done. Your accountant can do this for you
or you can do it yourself in the [Palkka.fi](https://www.palkka.fi/) service provided by the Tax administration.

* **Perform monthly bookkeeping**, *recurring* activity: even though there's no legal obligation to perform bookkeeping every month, accountants insist it is necessary and I trust their judgement
on this. If in a typical softwar project we regularly do backlog grooming so that the backlog wouldn't become a mess, it is understandable for me why accountants would want to resolve all transactions
every month when it's fresh in everyone's mind.

* **Submit financial statement and corporate income tax return**, *recurring* obligation: after the fiscal year ends, within 4 months you must submit
a financial statement and corporate income tax return. Your accountant can do this for you.

* **Share the receipts with your accountant**, *recurring* obligation: Primarily because Tax Administration must know what the purchase was for and whether it was
related to your *main line of business*, although it would also allow you to get the VAT back on eligible purchases.

Business Information System (ytj):

* **File notification of changes to company information**, *non-recurring* obligation: any changes to company information has to be
notified to Business Information System. For example, if your company's address changes, file a [notification of change](https://www.ytj.fi/en/index/notifications/notificationsofchanges/limitedliabilitycompanies.html).

TE-services:

* **Apply for startup grant payment**, *recurring* obligation: you must apply for startup grant payment retroactively within 2 months after the month you're applying for.
For example, if you're applying for the month of March, you have until end of May to apply.
