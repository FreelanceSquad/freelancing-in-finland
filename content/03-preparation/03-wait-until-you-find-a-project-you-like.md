### Wait until you find a project you like
**What is it?** Finding a freelance project is like finding a job. A lot has to be in order for you to find the right project.

It took me ~6 months from the time I got into the networks to find my first project that I liked. I've heard of couple of weeks from my peers too. It really varies, patience is necessary.

**Steps**:
* Once you find the right project, check the terms and conditions of the contract and run it by a lawyer if you have that available to you either through a union or elsewhere.
* If you're planning to [apply for startup grant](#apply-for-startup-grant), before you sign any contract, ask them to give you two weeks so that you can apply for startup grant and receive a decision.
Even though the official estimation is 2 weeks, decision comes much faster in reality (2-4 working days). Once you receive the decision, you can proceed.
* As you don't have a company yet, and you need to accept the contract, you can sign it **as a temporary solution** under your own name.
* The contract will be between a `natural person` (you) and a `legal entity` (the client's company or the freelance broker's company).
* You will sign a new contract once you establish your company. It will be between a `legal entity` (your company) and another `legal entity` (the client's company or the freelance broker's company).
* Your company would be selling freelance services by sending its representative (you).
