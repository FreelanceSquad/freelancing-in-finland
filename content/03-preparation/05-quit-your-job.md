### Quit your job

**What is it?** The positive decision to your startup grant is on the condition that you will quit your job and become a full-time entrepreneur.


**Steps**:
* **Terminology**: `employee` and `self-employed` are two different terms and they cannot be used interchangeably.
* As an `employee`, deliver your binding resignation in written form to your employer.
* After that, and from the first day of your startup grant decision, you are `self-employed`.
