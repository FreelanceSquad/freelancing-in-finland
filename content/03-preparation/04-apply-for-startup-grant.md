### Apply for startup grant

**Source of truth**: [TE-services startup grant page](https://www.te-palvelut.fi/te/en/employers/for_entrepreneurs/services_new_entrepreneurs/startup_grant/index.html)

**What is it?** Startup grant is a program to support you to become an entrepreneur.
You will receive the monthly payment for a total of 6 months (if you apply once) or a total of 12 months (if you apply for extension as well).

**How much?** ~705€ per month, as personal income. If your income tax is 10%, for example, you will get ~635€.
You must deliver a [revised tax card for social benefits](https://www.vero.fi/en/individuals/tax-cards-and-tax-returns/tax_card/tax_card_for_social_benefit/) to TE-services for them to use
your real income tax percentage, otherwise they withhold 25% income tax by default and you'll get ~530€.

**Steps** for first application:

* You will be disqualified from startup grant if you have established your company *and* started full-time entrepreneurship already.
    * What TE-services considers **establishment of company** is different from what we discuss in [establish your company](#establish-your-company) section.
    * TE-services considers your company as established if your company has joined any of the registeries maintained by Tax Administration (Prepayment, VAT, Employer).
    * This means that if you only join Trade register to get the unique Business ID when establishing your company, TE-services won't consider your company as established.
    * You can do this if you're in a hurry to setup things that depend on Business ID like opening a business bank account, applying for insurance offers, etc and you can't wait for startup grant decision to come first.

* You need a business plan and certain financial calculations as an attachment to your application.
You can use [My Enterprise Finland](https://oma.yrityssuomi.fi/#) and complete the steps for `Business plan` to
draw up your business plan which includes all necessary financial calculations as well.

* Once you have your business plan ready, as an **optional** step, you can send an email with your business plan attached to the
[Enterprise Agency in your city](https://www.uusyrityskeskus.fi/yritysneuvonta/uusyrityskeskukset/) and ask them for an appointment with a _Business Advisor_.
In Helsinki, [_NewCo Helsinki_](https://newcohelsinki.fi/en/) is the Enterprise Agency to go to. Although it is not mandatory to go to this appointment for getting startup grant,
the _Business Advisor_ has seen hundreds of business plans and can guide you to correct your mistakes in the business plan and therefore increase your chances for a successful application.

* You need an updated Resumé as an attachment to your application.

* You need a [tax debt certificate](https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/contact-us/efil/information-on-mytax/how-to-request-a-tax-debt-certificate-in-mytax/) as an attachment to your application.

* In your business plan, you have specified how much **own funding** you have available to you.
You need to provide a proof of your claimed own funding as an attachment to your application.
This proof doesn't have to be official. I personally printed a pdf from my netbank account overview and that was enough for a successful application.

* The amount of **own funding** available to you, no matter how high, does not influence the decision of TE-services negatively.
In addition, when applying for startup grant payments later once startup grant is granted, the salary you've taken from your own company does not affect the
payment application negatively either.

* Apply for startup grant [electronically](https://asiointi.mol.fi/omaasiointi/?kieli=fi) (only available in Finnish)
and you will get an electronic decision within 2 weeks (official estimation). Official decision letter should arrive by post soon after the decision is served (~1 week).

**Steps** for application extension:

* Apply **five months** after the starting date of previous grant but also **before it expires**.

* You need a short explanation of how the business has started.

* You need a short explanation of why the extension is being applied for.

* You need a summary report of your business actions during the startup grant period and plans for the near future.

* You need an *income statement*, self-made or verified by an accountant, of a 5-month-period, as an attachment to your application.

* You need a *balance sheet*, self-made or verified by an accountant, of a 5-month-period, as an attachment to your application.

* To determine whether to award the grant extension:

    * TE-services will consider whether the business has started more or less according to the original business plan.
    * TE-services will consider whether the already acquired income is enough to support the entrepreneur.

* Apply for the grant extension [electronically](https://asiointi.mol.fi/omaasiointi/?kieli=fi) (only available in Finnish)
and you will get an electronic decision within 2-4 weeks. Official decision letter should arrive by post soon after the decision is served (~1 week).
